%   TensorLab is a toolbox which facilitates the usage of vectors and 
%   tensors of arbitrary order in Matlab. The toolbox also allows for the 
%   definition of matrices, or even multi-dimensional arrays, of tensors.
%   Finite element implementations are one of many applications of the 
%   toolbox. It results in code which is more readable than traditional 
%   implementations based on compact matrix notation and it allows one to 
%   virtually reproduce written derivations in computer code. To this end, 
%   the TensorLab toolbox defines a new Matlab class called `tensor'. 
%   When operations are preformed on objects of this class, Matlab
%   automatically chooses the operations defined for it.
