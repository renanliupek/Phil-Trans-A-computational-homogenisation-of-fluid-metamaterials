function plot(X,varargin)

% PLOT(X,U)  Plot of tensor objects
% 
%   PLOT(X,U,Properties)
%     Plots (a column) U versus (a column) X. X has to be a (column of) 
%     vector(s). Depending on the order and basis of U, the resulting plot 
%     is different. PLOT(X,U) calls the correct plotting function.
%     
%     If U is a column of scalars, the resulting plot is a scatter plot, 
%     where the size and color of the dots indicate the corresponding
%     value. Plot uses the scatter function with some options already
%     specified. The function 
%       scatter(X,S,C,'filled')
%     is called. Here, S = C = U. Other options can still be specified.
%     Consult <a href = "matlab:help tensor/scatter">help tensor/scatter</a> for more information.
%
%     If U is a column of vectors, the resulting plot is a quiver plot,
%     where the vectors of U are plotted at starting positons X. If no
%     color is provided, the color is generated automatically, such that
%     the it represents the length of the vector.  Plot uses the quiver
%     function such that the scaling is off. I.e., the function
%       quiver(X,U,0)
%     is called. Other options can still be specified. 
%     Consult <a href = "matlab:help tensor/quiver">help tensor/quiver</a> for more information.

%     If U is a column of 2nd order tensors, the resulting plot is a quiver
%     plot, where the vectors correspond to the eigenvectors of the
%     components of U, with length equal to their eigenvalues. If no
%     color is provided, the color is generated automatically, such that
%     the it represents the respective eigenvalue.  Plot uses the quiver
%     function such that the scaling is off. I.e., the function
%       quiver(X,U,0)
%     is called. Other options can still be specified.
