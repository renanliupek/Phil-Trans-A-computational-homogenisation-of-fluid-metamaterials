function t2 = ttranspose(t1)

% TTRANSPOSE  Transpose of a tensor
%   B = TTRANSPOSE(A)
%     Gives the tensor transpose a A. For a single tensor the result is equal
%     to A' or A.'. For a matrix however, only the tensors are transposed.
%     The matrix is leaved untouched.

%     See also TRANSPOSE, CTRANSPOSE, RTRANSPOSE.
