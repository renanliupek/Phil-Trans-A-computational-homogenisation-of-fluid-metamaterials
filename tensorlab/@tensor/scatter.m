% SCATTER Scatter/bubble plot
%    SCATTER(X) plots markers at the positions indicated by X.
%
%    SCATTER(X,S,U) plots colored markers at the positions X. The size of
%    the markers (in points^2) is determined by the column matrix S which
%    must comprise only positive numbers. The color, on the other hand,
%    is determined by the column U (which may comprise both positive
%    and negative values). The values in U are linearly mapped to the
%    colors in the current colormap. A legend for the different colors
%    can therefore be added by subsequently executing:
%      scatter(X,S,U) 
%      colorbar
%    notice how X, S, and U are all of the same matrix dimensions.
%
%    SCATTER(X,[],U) plots colored markers at the positions X which are
%    all of the same size.
%    
%    SCATTER(...,'filled') fills the markers.
%
%    All properties of the regular Matlab scatter are applicable for its
%    Tensorlab counterpart.
